## Hi, I’m Fabio Franco 👋

A passionate **Senior Full-Stack Engineer** with over 25 years of experience building scalable software, with a strong focus on web applications and cloud solutions.

🚀 Currently leading the **Web Tier Team at CData** (formerly Data Virtuality), where I architect and develop a robust data virtualization SaaS application using **Angular** and **Java**, seamlessly integrating with APIs and other backend systems. I’m also the mind behind **ignite.rocks**, an AI-driven OKR management platform for organizations.

💡 I’ve worked across a wide spectrum of technologies — from **Java** (using frameworks like **Spring Boot**), **Next.js**, **SQL**, and **NoSQL** (such as **MongoDB**) on the backend, to **TypeScript** (with **Angular** and **React**), **SCSS**, and **Material Design** on the frontend. I’ve built infrastructure on **AWS**, managed **Kubernetes** deployments, and contributed to high-scale applications involving **Kafka** and **Argo Workflows**.

🧠 My passion for **AI** and **data engineering** drives me to explore cutting-edge tools and integrations, especially around AI-assisted web applications and productivity-focused SaaS platforms.

🎸 When I’m not coding, I’m likely playing guitar in my home studio, mixing tracks on **Logic Pro**, or training in **Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu**. I also love diving into astrophysics, physics, and all things sci-fi.

📬 Feel free to connect or check out my projects — I’m always open to collaboration and exciting new challenges.
